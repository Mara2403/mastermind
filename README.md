### What is mastermind?

Source [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game))

Mastermind or Master Mind is a **code-breaking game for two players** invented in Israel. One player becomes **the codemaker**, the other **the codebreaker**. The codemaker chooses a pattern of four code pegs. The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within eight to twelve turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the decoding board. Once placed, **the codemaker provides feedback** by placing from zero to four key pegs in the small holes of the row with the guess. A colored key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A white key peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position. Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or all rows on the decoding board are full.
